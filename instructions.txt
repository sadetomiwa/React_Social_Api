Using the Flask API that I made, create a blog front end for it using React. The API has a base url of https://kekambas-blog-api.onrender.com/

I have also attached a Postman Collection that should allow you to test all of the endpoints.


A user should be able to sign up, log in and log out. All users should be able to see all of the blog posts and get a single blog post. A logged in user should be able to create, update, and delete blog posts. 


Here are the endpoints:

- ['POST'] /api/users
- ['GET'] /api/me *Token Auth Required
- ['PUT'] /api/users/<user_id> *Token Auth Required
- ['DELETE'] /api/users/<user_id> *Token Auth Required
- ['POST'] /api/token  *Basic Auth Required

- ['POST'] /api/posts
- ['GET'] /api/posts
- ['GET'] /api/posts/<post_id>
- ['PUT'] /api/posts/<post_id> *Token Auth Required
- ['DELETE'] /api/posts/<post_id> *Token Auth Required
